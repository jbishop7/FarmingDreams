Welcome to FarmingDreams.

How to play:
WASD for movement
I to open your inventory
J to see your current objectives
E to interact

1, 2 to swap between tools. 

You will have an axe when you load in. Use this to chop trees. 
If you don't hear the noise, you missed the tree. Be patient. It runs on triggers.

You will need to collect wood to repair your farm, and then rebuild your crafting bench.

From there, you will need to collect materials from your farm and craft a new weapon. 

Once you craft a weapon, head into your tent to dive into the World of Nightmares.

There, you will fight a weak foe, and the demo will end.
